Hangman Game (Python Project)
This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic Hangman game. The game challenges the player to guess a randomly chosen word by suggesting letters one at a time. The objective is to guess the word correctly before running out of attempts.

Key Features:
Random Word Selection: The game selects a random word from a predefined list for each round.
User Input Validation: Ensures that the player inputs valid alphabetic characters and handles invalid entries gracefully.
Display of Progress: Shows the player the current state of the word, with correctly guessed letters revealed and underscores representing the remaining letters.
Tracking of Attempts: Keeps track of the player's remaining attempts and displays the letters they have already guessed.
Endgame Scenarios: Provides feedback at the end of the game, displaying a congratulatory message if the player wins or revealing the word if they lose.
Technologies Used:
Python for the core logic and game flow.
Built-in Python libraries for random word selection and user interaction.
How to Play:
Run the script to start the game.
Guess the word by entering one letter at a time.
You have a limited number of attempts to guess the entire word correctly.
The game will end when you either guess the word or run out of attempts.
This project was developed as part of the CodeAlpha Internship and serves as an example of using basic Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and string manipulation to create a simple yet engaging game.
