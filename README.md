### Hangman Game

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game. The game allows players to guess a hidden word one letter at a time, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game is lost. This project was developed as part of the CodeAlpha Internship and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts in Python.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection:** A random word is chosen from a predefined list at the start of each game.
- **User-Friendly Input:** The game ensures that only valid alphabetic characters are accepted as input, with prompts guiding the player.
- **Visual Progress Display:** The current state of the word is displayed, showing correctly guessed letters and underscores for the remaining ones.
- **Guess Tracking:** The game keeps track of the player's remaining attempts and displays the letters that have already been guessed.
- **Endgame Scenarios:** Provides feedback at the end of the game, congratulating the player if they win or revealing the correct word if they lose.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd hangman-game
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Hangman game script:
    ```bash
    python hangman.py
    ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the word, one letter at a time.
3. Try to guess the word correctly before you run out of attempts.

## Example Gameplay

- The game selects a random word, e.g., "_ _ _ _ _".
- The player guesses a letter, e.g., "e".
- If the letter is in the word, it appears in the correct position(s), e.g., "_ e _ _ _".
- The player continues guessing letters until they either guess the word or run out of attempts.
